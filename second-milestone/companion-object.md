* Java provides `static` keyword. Scala lacks static or class access. **Companion Object** gives you this opportunity

* Inside a Scala program, when you have a class and an object, with same names, underlying class becomes **Companion Class** and  respective object is called **Companion Object**

* Both **Companion Class** and its **Companion Object** must be defined in the same source file
